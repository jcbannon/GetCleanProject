The R script in this repository (run_analysis.R) constructs two datasets from the UCI HAR Dataset (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) which captures movement measurements of subjects wearing Samsung Galaxy S II smartphones. The measurements are associated with a given physical activity:

- WALKING
- WALKING_UPSTAIRS
- WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
- SITTING
- STANDING
- LAYING
